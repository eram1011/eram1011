## Hi there, I'm Eram.
I'm a Data Science student at IIT Madras, and I'm totally hooked on figuring out how machine learning can shake up and improve financial systems.
My primary goal is to develop and apply machine learning expertise, especially within the financial technology (FinTech) sector.

---

#### Skills

My technical toolkit includes: Python, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, SQL, Linux, Git, Flask, and GCP (Google Cloud Platform).

---

#### My current learning is centered on three core areas:

1. System Design: Mastering the architecture of distributed systems and building large-scale ML pipelines.
2. Model Quality: Developing skills in creating interpretable, reliable, and production-ready ML models and deployment workflows.
3. FinTech Application: Specifically applying AI to solve real-world problems in finance, like risk assessment, credit scoring, and fraud detection.

#### Collaboration

Let's team up! I'm specifically looking for opportunities to work on predictive analytics, financial risk modeling, fraud detection, and developing high-scale ML systems.
